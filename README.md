# Variable Closet
A greeting card for the partly closeted LGBTQIA+.

For every LGBTQIA+ person stuck in a situation where they are partly closeted, Variable Closet allows you to make a quick oversight for the supportive people in your life: your identity, orientation, what you like to be called. But also what you *have* to be called around certain people.
